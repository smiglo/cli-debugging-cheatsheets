# Command Line Debugging Cheatsheets

***Collection of language and runtime command-line debugging common actions***

## Index

- [Bash](./bash.md)
- [C](./c.md)
- [Node.js](./node.md)
- [Perl](./perl.md)
- [Python](./python.md)

## Why is this important?
1. :fire: You won't always have 3rd party tooling when debugging an issue
2. :neckbeard: Learn the native builtin support for debugging
3. :muscle: Decouple yourself (developer) from an IDE

## But why a collection? Why a GitHub repository?

- As a programmer of multiple languages :flushed: sometimes I need a glance at *current_language*'s cli debugging syntax
- During urgent debugging times :fire: where you need to debug via cli a concise and to-the-point cheatsheet saves valuable time :alarm_clock:
- A consistent experience for all languages/runtimes via a template :relieved: 

## Help make this better!

I'm only one developer that only works with a subset of languages. Don't see your beloved *programming_language*? :open_mouth: Add it!

1. Fork this repo
